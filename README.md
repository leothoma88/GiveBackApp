# The GiveBack App

This fullstack MERN project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Local Usability

First, download the code to your machine, open your terminal and run:

### `npm install`

This will install all of the dependencies used in this application. 

Then still inside the terminal, run:

### `npm run build`

This builds the app for production and will open the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
